#Step 5 - Karma

Install NPM modules:

    npm install

Install client-side dependencies:

    bower install

You will also need the globally installed command line interface for Karma (potentially with sudo):

    npm install -g karma-cli

If Bower is not installed on your system yet:

    npm install -g bower

If you run into permission issues, run this instead:

    sudo npm install -g bower
